# unreal-cinematics (Authoring stage)

Create and edit Level Sequences, add camera cuts and actor bindings,
author transform keyframes, control playback range, and prepare cinematic jobs
for the Movie Render Queue. Starting a render and verifying output are outside
this skill's current contract.

## Workflow

1. Call `create_level_sequence` to create a new sequence asset.
2. Use `add_actor_to_sequence` to bind actors as sequence tracks.
3. Author keyframes with `add_transform_keyframe`.
4. Add camera cuts via `add_camera_cut_track` for shot switching.
5. Set playback ranges with `set_playback_range`.
6. Inspect sequence state with `get_sequence_info`.
7. Add an MRQ job with `queue_sequence_render`, start it with `start_queued_render`, poll `get_render_status`, and use `cancel_queued_render` when the output is rejected.

When UE 5.8+ official MCP is available, the `unreal-official-mcp` skill
provides additional Sequencer tools through Epic's toolset registry.
Prefer the official path for complex shot workflows.

## Scripts

- `create_level_sequence` — Create a new Level Sequence asset in the Content Browser
- `open_level_sequence` — Open a Level Sequence in the Sequencer editor
- `add_actor_to_sequence` — Bind an actor as a track in a Level Sequence
- `add_transform_keyframe` — Add location/rotation/scale keyframes at a time
- `set_playback_range` — Set the sequence start and end frame
- `get_sequence_info` — Inspect tracks, bindings, and playback range
- `add_camera_cut_track` — Add a camera cut track for shot switching
- `queue_sequence_render` — Configure an active-session MRQ job, optionally with an OCIO display transform, without starting a render
- `start_queued_render` — Start the active MRQ queue
- `get_render_status` — Inspect active MRQ state
- `cancel_queued_render` — Cancel the active MRQ executor and skip remaining jobs
